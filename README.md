Absolutely, Shane — here’s your GitHub-ready package, polished and structured for optimal readability, fast loading, and modular clarity. I’ve broken it into logical “packets” with spacing and sectioning that GitHub’s markdown renderer will auto-break cleanly. This layout ensures quick visual parsing, faster scroll performance, and intuitive navigation for contributors and users.

🛠️ Environment Setup

🔹 Step 1: Create a Setup Script

Create a file named setup_env.sh in your project root and paste:

`bash

!/bin/bash
echo "source ~/Projects/ResaTones/setup_env.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrcsource setup_env.shfirebase login
firebase init
firebase deploy

🔧 Java Environment
export JAVA8HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
export JAVA11HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64"
export JAVAHOME="$JAVA11_HOME"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"

📦 Android SDK & Firebase CLI
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk"
export PATH="$ANDROIDHOME/tools:$ANDROIDHOME/platform-tools:$PATH"

export FIREBASE_HOME="$HOME/.firebase"
export PATH="$FIREBASE_HOME/bin:$PATH"

🎸 ResaTones Project Paths
export RESATONESPROJECTDIR="$HOME/Projects/ResaTones"
export RESATONESASSETSDIR="$RESATONESPROJECTDIR/assets"
export RESATONESSCHEMATICSDIR="$RESATONESPROJECTDIR/schematics"
export RESATONESAIMODULE="$RESATONESPROJECTDIR/modules/ai-effects"
export RESATONESSYMBOLICGEOMETRY="$RESATONESPROJECTDIR/geometry/symbolic"

🧪 Firebase Emulator Flag
export FIREBASE_EMULATORS="true"
firebase emulators:start
🧼 Build Alias
alias cleanresatones='cd $RESATONESPROJECT_DIR && ./gradlew clean'

🚀 Firebase Studio Alias
alias launchfirebasestudio='firebase open hosting:site'

echo "✅ ResaTones environment configured successfully."

🔹 Step 2: Apply the Environment

Run the script manually:

`bash

`

Or auto-load it on terminal launch:

`bash
echo "source ~/Projects/ResaTones/setup_env.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
`

🚀 Firebase Deployment

🔸 Initialize & Deploy

`bash
firebase login
firebase init
firebase deploy
`

🔸 Local Emulator Testing

`bash
firebase emulators:start
`

Ensure your firebase.json includes:

`json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "/.", "/node_modules/*"]
  },
  "emulators": {
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5000
    },
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    }
  }
}
`
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"]
  },
  "emulators": {
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5000
    },
    "functions": {

🧩 GitHub Optimization Tips

- ✅ Use .gitattributes to enforce LF line endings for clean diffs
- ✅ Add .editorconfig for consistent formatting across IDEs
- ✅ Keep setupenv.sh executable: chmod +x setupenv.sh
- ✅ Use .gitignore to exclude build artifacts and Firebase tokens

Would you like me to generate the full folder structure and starter files (setup_env.sh, firebase.json, .gitignore, etc.) as a zipped repo layout next?
